#Implement a Minimal Viable Data Product Using Deeplearning4J

This project demonstrates data flows and interaction between core components of a data-product. Our example use-case is automatic classification of images using neural networks. 

After reading the article you will be able:
- to use DL4J in a Spark session / CDSW
- persist labeled training data in Kudu (in order to slice and dice the training set)
- execute a learned model in a Spark-shell session
- execute a learned model in a Spark-streaming job

This means: we go from learning to production, not perfectly robust, but end-2-end!
